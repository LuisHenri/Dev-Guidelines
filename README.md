# Developer Guidelines

Some rules and advices for developers who want to contribute to these or their projects and keep them human friendly.


# Git
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used as the version control system. Each developer must be familiar with the basic functionality of git before contributing to the project. If necessary, look at this [guide](https://githowto.com/).

## Commit messages
[**Conventional Commits** specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) shall be used for commit messages. Read the specification carefully and use [this compact list of conventional commit types](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json) to help you. You'll quickly get used to it!

Common types of commit messages:

| Type      | Meaning                                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| docs:     | Documentation only changes.                                |
| feat:     | A new feature.                                             |
| fix:      | A bug fix.                                                 |
| refactor: | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature. |
| perf:     | A code change that improves performance.                   |
| style:    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code.        |

Basic rules:

 - Try to keep the first line under 72 characters.
 - A blank line must separate the subject from the description.
 - Use the **imperative** voice.


## Branching rules
In the project, the following branch types are recommended:

| Type            | Branch   | Meaning                                          |
|-----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Stable          | stable   | Accepts merges from Working and Hotfixes         |
| Working         | master   | Accepts merges from Features/Issues and Hotfixes |
| Features/Issues | topic/*	 | Always branch off HEAD of Working                 |
| Hotfix          | hotfix/* | Always branch of Stable                          |

`topic` can be defined (but not limited to) as `feat`, `fix` and `docs`. Each commit to the `stable` branch must contain a tag with the following format: `<version>-stable`. See the [article](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848) for detailed information.

> **Warning:** branch naming rules from the article are NOT used in this project – only 
branching rules.


## Updating the Stable branch
Sometimes it might be a little tricky to update the Stable branch.  
It should be updated with the latest stable features.

1. Create a new branch from the Master (or from the latest stable commit on it, if there are already new features in development inside the master branch). Let's call it **"chore/update-stable-branch"**.
2. Run `git merge -s ours origin/stable`.
3. Push the new branch to the cloud with `git push`.
3. Create a PR from `chore/update-stable-branch` to `stable`.
4. Check for any conflicts.
5. Complete the PR.
6. Done! :)

### Hints
  - **Do not** forget to remove the branch after a successful Pull Request to the main branch to prevent contamination of the repository.
  - **Do not** make additional changes in a branch that is already merged with the main one.
  - If the changes are small and there is no danger of conflicts, consider making a **squash merge** to keep the git history more compact and readable.
  - To enrich your changes, include at least one colleague as a reviewer for your PR. On the other hand, if you're a reviewer, make comments and give tips on how to improve it.


## Pre-commit, using black and flake8 linting when pushing new changes
It is recommended to have *pre-commit* installed and configured in order to keep the repository and its code organized.

`pre-commit` is a tool that runs some hooks (wait for it) **before** the **commit**, such as `black`, `flake8` or any other hook you wish.

Usually it should be already inside the `requirements-dev.txt` file and therefore you could just run `pip install -U -r requirements-dev.txt`. However, if you want to manually install it, run `pip install pre-commit`.

After running either of the commands above, run `pre-commit install`, with or without `--allow-missing-config`. Terminal should return `pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit`. 

> Optionally, you can run against all files by using `pre-commit run --all-files`. You will get a 'Failed' or 'Passed' status.  
Black can be run manually by using `python -m black ./`  
If there are weird errors appearing, you can try to `pre-commit autoupdate`

**Note:** You need to configure a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` before you can use pre-commit. Here you can define all tests and linters you would like to use.  
Here's an example:

```yaml
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 21.9b0
    hooks:
    -   id: black
-   repo: https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 3.9.2
    hooks:
    - id: flake8
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.0.1
    hooks:
    -   id: check-added-large-files
    -   id: end-of-file-fixer
    -   id: trailing-whitespace
```


# VERSIONING
For versioning of the packages [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) is used. Read the specification carefully and take a look at the [how-to guide](https://github.com/dbrock/semver-howto) to SemVer.

# CODE

## Imports
Try to follow the [PEP8](https://pep8.org/#imports). In summary:

- Import order: Built-ins, Third-parties, Locals. First the `import ...` then the
  `from ... import ...`

- Prioritize Absolute Imports over Relative Imports (e.g., `import pkg_a.utils`)

- Use `as` to reduce the verbosity (e.g., `import pkg_a.pkg_b.pkg_c.utils as pkg_utils`)

- Prioritize `import ... as ...` for modules and packages

- Avoid `from ... import ...`. But if needed, use it for importing specific functions/classes from a module/package

- Leave `__init__.py` empty unless needed (e.g., making a function from a module accessible from the package. Even on these cases, prioritize absolute imports)

## Style
[flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is used for style guide checking. Usually, CI build of the projects runs linting with flake8 and the build will not be succeeded without corresponding styling. Before committing the code, don't forget to check styling locally. Various python IDEs also support the integration of flake8. Standard flake8 configuration for this project is as follows:

```
[flake8]
# Matching the black line length (default 88)
max-line-length = 88
max-complexity = 10
extend-ignore =
    # See https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/373
    E203,
    F811,
exclude =
    .flake8,
    .git,
    .venv*,
    .env*,
    .bkp*,
    __pycache__,
    # Add your folders to ignore here
    build/,
    output/,
    bin/,
    dist/,
```

## Docstrings
In this project reStructuredText (reST) Docstring Format is used, according to proposal in [PEP 287](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0287/). See the example of such formatting [here](http://queirozf.com/entries/python-docstrings-reference-examples). **A docstring for each function and class are recommended.**


# Readme
Each repository **must** have a README with **at least**:

* Short blurb about the service and what it does
* Describe how to install all development dependencies
* Instructions about how to run the service as well as the tests

Take a look at the READMEs of other repos if you need some inspiration! :D


# Contributing
Each repository **can** have a CONTRIBUTING with the necessary information for new developers to be able to contribute with the Project.
